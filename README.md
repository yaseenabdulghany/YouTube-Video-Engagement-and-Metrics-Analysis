This project provides an in-depth analysis of YouTube video engagement metrics using Python. The dataset includes daily metrics like views, likes, comments, shares, and more, enabling the exploration of trends, audience behavior, and factors contributing to video success.  

## Features  
- Analysis of key engagement metrics (views, likes, comments, shares).  
- Exploration of relationships between metrics like views and average view duration.  
- Visualization of trends over time using matplotlib and seaborn.  
- Insights into factors driving subscriber gains and losses.  
- Evaluation of the impact of annotations and cards on engagement.  

## Tools Used  
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **matplotlib**: For creating static visualizations.  
- **seaborn**: For generating insightful and aesthetic data visualizations.  

## Dataset  
This dataset contains detailed engagement metrics for YouTube videos over time, such as:  
- **Views**: Daily view counts for each video.  
- **Likes & Comments**: Indicators of audience interaction.  
- **Shares**: Frequency of video sharing.  
- **Annotations & Cards**: Interaction data for video annotations and cards.  
- **Subscribers**: Gains and losses of subscribers due to videos.  

## Key Questions Explored:
1. Which videos had the highest engagement (views, likes, comments, and shares)?
2. Is there a relationship between views and average view duration?
3. What is the impact of annotations and cards on engagement?
4. Are viewers more likely to click on cards or teaser cards?
5. What drives subscriber gains and losses?
6. Which videos caused the most significant subscriber losses?
7. How has engagement changed over time?
8. Are there seasonal trends in video performance?
